**Real Estate Price Prediction**
**Project Overview:**
This project uses machine learning to predict real estate prices based on factors like location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to help buyers, sellers, and agents make informed decisions.

**Key Features:**

1)Data preprocessing and cleaning.
2)Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights.
3)Building a predictive model using algorithms like Linear Regression.
4)Model evaluation 
5)Visualizing predictions 
6)**Technologies Used:**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas,  Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Environment: colab Notebook or any Python IDE
**How to Use the Project:**

-->**Clone the repository**: git clone <https://github.com/reihan114/Real_Estate_Price_prediction>
-->**Install dependencies:** pip install -r requirements.txt
-->Run the scripts/notebooks to preprocess data, train the model, and predict prices.
-->**Dataset:**
The dataset includes real estate details like property location, area, price, number of bedrooms, and other relevant features. It is sourced from publicly available real estate data or generated synthetically for demonstration purposes.
