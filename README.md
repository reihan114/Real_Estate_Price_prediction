## Introduction
Real estate prices are influenced by multiple factors such as location, property size, and market conditions. This project builds a machine learning model to analyze historical data and predict prices. 

By using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression models, this project provides insights into the features that have the most impact on real estate prices and develops a robust prediction model.

---

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data visualization to identify key trends and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use of R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains real estate property information, including:
- Property Size (square feet)
- Location (encoded)
- Number of Rooms
- Market Price

### Note:
The dataset is sourced from [add source here if public]. If unavailable, users can use similar datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Modeling Approach
1. **EDA:**
   - Visualized data distributions and correlations.
   - Identified outliers and missing values.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical variables.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Built and compared multiple regression models.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest Regressor.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated model accuracy with R-squared and MAE metrics.

## Results
- **Best Model:** [Add the name of the best model, e.g., Random Forest Regressor]
- **Performance:**
  - R-squared: [Add value]
  - MAE: [Add value]
- Key factors influencing price: [List important features like location, size, etc.]
